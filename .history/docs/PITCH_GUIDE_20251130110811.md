## Pitch Structure (Draft)

### 1. The Hook (15 seconds)
Grab attention immediately. Options:
- Shocking statistic
- Compelling question
- Brief story/scenario
- Bold statement

**Example:** "Every day, 40% of young people experience harassment online. But what if we could catch the warning signs before it escalates?"

### 2. The Problem (30 seconds)
- What's broken? Be specific.
- Who's affected? Make it human.
- Why does it matter? Stakes.
- Why now? Urgency.

**Tip:** Use insights from the hackathon talks to demonstrate understanding.

### 3. Our Solution (45 seconds)
- What we built (one sentence)
- How it works (simple explanation)
- Key innovation (what's new/different)

**Tip:** Lead with the *what*, then the *how*. Don't get lost in technical details.

### 4. Demo (60 seconds)
- Show the product working
- Focus on the "aha moment"
- Narrate what you're showing
- Use real (or realistic) examples

**Tip:** Record demo separately, edit into pitch video. Rehearse the flow.

### 5. Impact (30 seconds)
- Who benefits and how
- Potential scale
- Measurable outcomes
- Broader implications

**Example:** "This could help moderators review 3x more content, catching harmful patterns 40% earlier."

### 6. Team & Close (15 seconds)
- Brief team intro (names/skills)
- Call to action or memorable close
- Thank you

## Pitch Tips

### Do:
- **Tell a story** — Problems are more compelling through human examples
- **Show, don't tell** — Demo > slides about features
- **Be specific** — "Reduces review time by 40%" beats "makes moderation easier"
- **Acknowledge limitations** — Shows maturity and honesty
- **Practice out loud** — Timing feels different when speaking

### Don't:
- Start with team introductions (save for end)
- Use jargon without explanation
- Show too many features (focus on 1-3 key ones)
- Read from a script (use bullet points instead)
- Rush the demo

## Slide Suggestions

If using slides, keep them minimal:

| Slide | Content |
|-------|---------|
| 1. Hook | Bold statement or question |
| 2. Problem | Key statistic + who's affected |
| 3. Solution | One-liner + simple diagram |
| 4. Demo | Live demo or video embed |
| 5. Impact | Numbers + vision |
| 6. Team | Photo + names + skills |

**Rule of thumb:** If you can't read the slide in 3 seconds, it has too much text.

## Demo Recording Tips

1. **Clean your screen** — Hide bookmarks, notifications, personal tabs
2. **Use fake/sample data** — Don't show real user data
3. **Increase font size** — Make sure text is readable in video
4. **Pre-load everything** — Don't wait for API calls during recording
5. **Have a backup** — Record multiple takes
6. **Keep it short** — 60-90 seconds max for demo portion

| Criteria | What They're Looking For |
|----------|--------------------------|
| **Impact** | Does this solve a real problem? How many people does it help? |
| **Innovation** | Is this a new approach? Creative use of technology? |
| **Execution** | Does it work? Is the demo polished? |
| **Feasibility** | Could this actually be built/scaled? |
| **Presentation** | Is the pitch clear, compelling, well-structured? |
| **Team** | Right skills? Can they execute? |
