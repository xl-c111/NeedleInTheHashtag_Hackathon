A lot of what you’re feeling (loneliness, overthinking, hating your appearance, wondering if you’ll ever be loved) is way more common than you think, it’s just that most people hide it as well as you do. The key right now isn’t “give up on girls” or “only date guys,” it’s getting out of the mindset that you need to be objectively hot or effortlessly social to be wanted. Keep working on your confidence, style, and social comfort the same way you’d level up in a game, small, consistent moves. Say yes to low pressure hangs, practice being warm even when it feels awkward, and don’t be afraid to date whoever actually shows interest and makes you feel good.",

Will you achieve a sense of community? Sure, but on that note, I could go find a toxic ass man on the street and make him my bf and give myself a life of misery just to not be alone. I could do it, but I would be miserable. I like being on my own, even though I do believe I’ll find my person when the time is right.\n\nI think it could be helpful to find activities you enjoy, preferably ones that require you to go out into the community (or ones with online communities) and create a routine that makes you happy! It is so important to enjoy being in your own company. It protects you from devaluing yourself which I believe makes it easier to be manipulated or settle for bullshit in relationships.

The constant scanning to see what might be wrong with you is actually part of what sustains the incel mindset in my opinion. Knowing that you want to work towards a more stable way of viewing the world and being less angry/negative is the hardest part. The beliefs that incels typically hold are ironically the thing that keeps them feeling miserable.\n\nSo yeah you understanding that not every touch or hug or interaction is inherently an attack on you is the biggest hurdle so i congratulate you. Now you have the orientation so it's just about learning emotional maturity, practicing mindfulness and emotional regulation. When you have a thought try to step outside yourself for a moment and ask, is this belief I'm entertaining making me angry, more upset or activated? If I act on this belief in front of others, are they going to see me as kind and warm or defensive and narrow?\n\nTrust your own growth, try not to rush yourself. Trusting that you are going exactly the right pace will help you stay present and in a posture to learn every day. You're on a magic carpet ride of life now and what helps me is realizing that this is my life and I get to live according to my values, not what others say I should value. Above all remember that each person you encounter is on as complex a journey as you are. This will give you patience and love for others. Proud of you OP.",

    "content": "Well you're being way too hard on yourself for one lol. Give yourself a break.\n\nI guess step 1 is stop calling yourself an incel (assuming you do). It's not an objective descriptor, its a made-up identity. You don't follow the incel mindset and you don't like their weird memes. You're \"not like other incels\" like a duck is not like a bunch of cats.\n\nI guess my number one advice would be: ok, you're looking for a job? Good. Focus on that. Yes, work out and do skin care or whatever, but even that's to help. This is advice I'm increasingly focusing on because all the fucking recession indicators I'm seeing, but also because its just a good thing to focus on that can build your confidence, skills, idea of yourself, and eventually your bank account.",

    "content": "> The height issue isn’t that big of a deal though, since I see a lot of men at my workplace in relationships and they aren’t rich or handsome either.\n\nAnd I see plenty of Asian guys in relationships too. Simply getting out of the incel internet bubble and meeting people in real life is the best counter-argument to incel beliefs.\n\n> Stuff like my height (5'8\"), being East Asian, or my looks making me “undesirable,”\n\nThe average height in the US is 5'9 so your height of 5'8 is in the average range and isn't considered short. I know you aren't certain of this, but what is the case of a 5'8 height making you undesirable to all women?\n\nhttps://www.health.com/average-height-for-men-7501601\n\nhttps://www.huffpost.com/entry/okcupid-race_n_5811840\n\nhttps://home.uchicago.edu/~hortacsu/onlinedating.pdf\n\nTwo problems here:\n\n1. Even these stats how that Asian men don't have zero success or results on online dating, just reduced results on average. This conflicts with the claim that \"I’m not good enough and never will be for anybody.\"\n2. The standard deviation should be taken into account because very few individuals reflect the absolute average.\n3. The vast majority of people aren't online dating experts and certainly aren't dating optimally in general. So these statistics don't show nothing you will do will ever work.\n4. Dating apps are 75% men and text on a screen lacks that in person connection. As a result competition among men is very fierce and pics and looks have disproportionate importance. Incel arguments often assume all dating is online dating which is categorically false.\n5. These sources don't actually directly show that a high proportion of asian men are long term single and never get into a relationship. I haven't found a single study that proves this.",
