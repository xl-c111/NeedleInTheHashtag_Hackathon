I remember when I first started my journey, I would get so caught up in trying to track every little thing, from calories to macros. But as I continued on my path, I realized that true freedom came from letting go of those restrictions and focusing on nourishing my body, rather than trying to control it.

14,"I appreciate the enthusiasm for fitness, but as someone who's navigated ED recovery, I want to share a different perspective. For me, 'discipline' evolved from rigid calorie counting to intuitive eating. When I stopped tracking obsessively, my body started healing in ways I hadn't expected - like my hair regrowing and my energy stabilizing. Health at every size isn't just a phrase for me; it's a lived experience. Maybe we can explore how individual therapy helped me reframe 'progress' as listening to my body's needs, not just hitting metrics?
