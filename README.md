## 🎯 The Problem

Young men face unique challenges with loneliness and isolation, often struggling to find spaces where they can openly share and connect. Village provides a peer-to-peer support platform where they can:
- Share their stories anonymously
- Connect with others who understand
- Find resources and support

## 🚀 Quick Start (Frontend)

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000
