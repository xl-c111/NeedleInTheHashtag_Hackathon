## The Challenges

### Mini-Challenge: Persona Classification

The organizers have built a fake social media platform with AI personas posting, commenting, and chatting. The task is to classify who is who from millions of messages.

**Target Personas:**
- Body dysmorphia indicators
- Incel language patterns
- LinkedIn Lunatic posting style
- Other behavioral patterns TBD

**Likely Approach:**
- Text classification using keyword patterns, ML, or LLMs
- User-level aggregation (multiple messages per user)
- Clustering to find natural groupings

### Grand Challenge: eSafety Solution Demo

Design and build a demo addressing online safety issues. This requires:
1. Understanding the problem deeply (mentor interviews, talks)
2. Identifying a specific angle/user need
3. Building a working demo
4. Pitching the solution

**Potential Directions:**
- Early intervention systems (detect warning signs)
- Bystander support tools (help friends recognize risks)
- Counter-messaging (generate supportive responses)
- Moderator copilot (AI-assisted moderation)
- Educational simulators (show how manipulation works)
- Gaming safety (real-time toxicity intervention)
