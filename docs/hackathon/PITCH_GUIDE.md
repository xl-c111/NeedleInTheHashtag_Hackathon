## Our Motto Options

Choose one for the pitch (or use in rotation):

1. **"Bringing a village to your screen. Connect with people who truly understand."** ⭐ (PRIMARY)
2. "Your village, just a message away. Real people. Real experiences. Real support."
3. "You're not alone. Connect with others who've lived what you're living."
4. "Find your people. Share stories with those who get it."
5. "Where real experiences meet real connection."
6. "A village of support — right on your screen."
7. "Talk to people who understand, because they've been there too."

## Key Messages

These should be woven throughout the pitch:

### 1. The Problem
**"Online echo chambers are radicalizing young people, increasing misogyny, and correlating with higher rates of gender-based violence."**

- Incel communities started as support spaces but have become toxic echo chambers
- Exposure to extreme content increases radicalization and harmful beliefs
- Research links misogynistic views to domestic violence and gender-based violence
- Current approaches (deplatforming) don't address root causes

### 2. The Solution
**"We connect people to real stories from those who've overcome similar struggles — not AI therapy, but real human connection."**

- AI matches users to relevant mentor posts (doesn't generate advice)
- Real stories from reformed community members (e.g., r/IncelExit)
- Multi-perspective content breaks echo chambers
- Combines peer support + professional resources + self-reflection

### 3. Why It Matters
**"Prevention through de-radicalization and human connection reduces the risk of gender-based violence."**

- Intervene before beliefs become entrenched
- Provide hope through authentic examples of positive change
- Foster empathy by exposing users to diverse perspectives
- Connect to professional help without stigma

### 4. What Makes It Different
**"Real human stories, not AI-generated content. AI only matches people to lived experiences."**

- Authenticity over automation
- Peer support proven more effective than algorithms alone
- Privacy-first, stigma-free environment
- Wholesome interactions inspired by successful games like "Kind Words"

## Pitch Structure

**Total Time: 3 minutes**

### 1. The Hook (15 seconds)
**Goal:** Grab attention with the urgency and scope of the problem

**Script:**
> "Every day, young people are falling into online echo chambers that promote misogyny and radicalization. Research shows a direct link between these beliefs and gender-based violence. But what if we could connect them to people who've been there and found their way out?"

**Alternatives:**
- Stat: "Studies show that holding misogynistic views significantly increases the risk of domestic violence..."
- Question: "What if the solution to online radicalization wasn't deplatforming, but connection?"

---

### 2. The Problem (30 seconds)
**Goal:** Make the problem specific, human, and urgent

**Script:**
> "Online communities that were once created as support spaces — like early incel forums — have been overtaken by extreme viewpoints. These echo chambers reinforce loneliness, spread misinformation, and radicalize vulnerable young people, particularly young men.
>
> The impact? Higher rates of misogyny, isolation, and tragically, gender-based violence. Deplatforming doesn't work — users just migrate and feel martyred. We need a better approach."

**Key points to hit:**
- Incel communities are echo chambers (but don't say "platform for incels")
- Young people are vulnerable and being radicalized
- Current solutions (deplatforming) don't address root causes
- There's a link to gender-based violence (the hackathon theme)

---

### 3. Our Solution (45 seconds)
**Goal:** Clearly explain what we built and how it works

**Script:**
> "We built a peer-support platform that brings a village to your screen. Here's how it works:
>
> When someone is struggling with loneliness, relationships, or self-esteem, they share their story through our AI chat. But here's the key — the AI doesn't give advice. Instead, it matches them to real posts from people who've lived through similar challenges and come out stronger.
>
> These are authentic stories from reformed community members, people from different genders and backgrounds, showing that change is possible. We combine this with professional resources, a private diary for reflection, and wholesome interactions — no toxic comments, just support."

**Key innovation to emphasize:**
- AI for matching, NOT for generating therapy
- Real human stories from lived experience
- Multi-perspective content (breaks echo chambers)
- Human connection at the core

---

### 4. Demo (60 seconds)
**Goal:** Show the product working through our 7-step user journey

**Demo Script (narrate while showing):**

> "Let me show you how it works.
>
> **[Step 1]** Meet Alex, a young person feeling isolated and lonely. They come to our platform and describe their struggles.
>
> **[Step 2]** Our AI chat helps them articulate what they're going through — not giving advice, just listening and understanding.
>
> **[Step 3]** Based on what Alex shared, they're matched to real stories from mentors who felt the same way and improved their lives. Look — here's someone who used to struggle with loneliness and found connection through volunteering.
>
> **[Step 4]** Alex saves the posts that resonate, marking them to revisit later.
>
> **[Step 5]** They explore perspectives from people of different genders and backgrounds — seeing that these feelings are universal, not unique to them.
>
> **[Step 6]** Alex starts journaling in their private diary, reflecting on their journey and tracking their progress.
>
> **[Step 7]** Finally, they access curated resources — mental health services, articles on building self-esteem, all tailored to their needs.
>
> This is prevention through connection."

**Demo Tips:**
- Use a relatable scenario (loneliness, not extreme incel language)
- Show each of the 7 steps visually
- Emphasize the matching (not AI generation)
- End on a hopeful note (resources, progress)

### 5. Impact (30 seconds)
**Goal:** Show who benefits and why it matters at scale

**Script:**
> "This matters because we're preventing radicalization before it takes hold. By connecting people to real stories of change, we break echo chambers and build empathy. By providing stigma-free access to resources, we make it easier to get help.
>
> The impact? Reduced radicalization, decreased misogyny, and ultimately, fewer instances of gender-based violence. We're addressing the root cause — isolation and harmful beliefs — with the most powerful tool we have: human connection.
>
> And this can scale. There are millions of people struggling, and thousands willing to share their recovery stories. We're building the village they need."

**Key impact points:**
- Prevention (before radicalization entrenches)
- Scalability (millions of users, thousands of mentors)
- Measurable (reduced harmful beliefs, increased help-seeking)
- Addresses hackathon theme (gender-based violence prevention)

---

### 6. Team & Close (15 seconds)
**Goal:** Humanize the team and end memorably

**Script:**
> "We're a team of engineers, designers, and researchers who believe that connection can change minds. We've built the foundation in 48 hours, and we're ready to scale it.
>
> Thank you. Let's bring a village to every screen."

**Alternative closes:**
- "Because everyone deserves to know they're not alone."
- "Real stories. Real connection. Real change."
- "Join us in building a safer, more connected online world."

## Important Notes for Pitch Delivery

### Language & Framing
- **Don't say "platform for incels"** - Keep generic ("peer-support platform," "people struggling with loneliness")
- **Emphasize human connection over AI** - Make it clear AI is a tool, not the solution
- **Use real examples** - Reference r/IncelExit, deradicalization programs (Indonesia), Kind Words game
- **Avoid "gamification"** - Frame as "wholesome interactions" or "positive reinforcement," not games

### Moderation & Safety
- **Foster healthy human connection** - This is the core message
- **Help people when they struggle** - Supportive, not punitive approach
- **Lived experiences matter** - Real stories are more powerful than algorithms
- **AI controls hate speech** - But doesn't replace human judgment

### What NOT to Say
- "AI therapist" or "AI-generated advice" ❌
- "Targeting incels" ❌
- "Gamification to make it fun" ❌ (sounds trivializing)
- Technical jargon (embeddings, cosine similarity, etc.) ❌

### What TO Say
- "AI matches people to real human stories" ✓
- "Supporting people through difficult times" ✓
- "Wholesome interactions inspired by Kind Words" ✓
- "Prevention through connection" ✓

## Pitch Tips

### Do:
- **Tell a story** — Problems are more compelling through human examples
- **Show, don't tell** — Demo > slides about features
- **Be specific** — "Reduces review time by 40%" beats "makes moderation easier"
- **Acknowledge limitations** — Shows maturity and honesty
- **Practice out loud** — Timing feels different when speaking

### Don't:
- Start with team introductions (save for end)
- Use jargon without explanation
- Show too many features (focus on 1-3 key ones)
- Read from a script (use bullet points instead)
- Rush the demo

## Slide Suggestions

If using slides, keep them minimal:

| Slide | Content |
|-------|---------|
| 1. Hook | Bold statement or question |
| 2. Problem | Key statistic + who's affected |
| 3. Solution | One-liner + simple diagram |
| 4. Demo | Live demo or video embed |
| 5. Impact | Numbers + vision |
| 6. Team | Photo + names + skills |

**Rule of thumb:** If you can't read the slide in 3 seconds, it has too much text.

---

## Demo Recording Tips

1. **Clean your screen** — Hide bookmarks, notifications, personal tabs
2. **Use fake/sample data** — Don't show real user data
3. **Increase font size** — Make sure text is readable in video
4. **Pre-load everything** — Don't wait for API calls during recording
5. **Have a backup** — Record multiple takes
6. **Keep it short** — 60-90 seconds max for demo portion

## Key Messages to Convey

Use these throughout your pitch and when talking to judges:

1. **Problem in one sentence:**
   > Online echo chambers are radicalizing young people, increasing misogyny, and correlating with higher rates of gender-based violence.

2. **Solution in one sentence:**
   > We connect people to real stories from those who've overcome similar struggles — not AI therapy, but AI-powered matching to real human connection.

3. **Why it matters:**
   > Prevention through de-radicalization and human connection reduces the risk of gender-based violence by addressing root causes (isolation, harmful beliefs) before they become entrenched.

4. **What makes it different:**
   > Real human stories, not AI-generated content. AI only matches people to lived experiences. Privacy-first, stigma-free, and scalable through volunteer mentor contributions.
